These may be hard to implement at large spatial scales. In contrast, binomial mixture models enable abundance estimation without individual identification, based simply on temporally and spatially replicated counts. Here, we evaluate mixture models using data from the national breeding bird monitoring program in Switzerland, where some 250 1-km(2) quadrats are surveyed using the territory mapping method three times during each breeding season. We chose eight species with contrasting distribution (wide-narrow), abundance (high-low), and detectability (easy-difficult). Abundance was modeled as a random effect with a Poisson or negative binomial distribution, with mean affected by forest cover, elevation, and route length. Detectability was a logit-linear function of survey date, survey date-by-elevation, and sampling effort (time per transect unit). Resulting covariate effects and parameter estimates were consistent with expectations. Detectability per territory (for three surveys) ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 (mean 0.84) for easy species, and from 0.16 to 0.83 (mean 0.53) for difficult species, depended on survey effort for two easy and all four difficult species, and changed seasonally for three easy and three difficult species. Abundance was positively related to route length in three high-abundance and one low-abundance (one easy and three difficult) species, and increased with forest cover in five forest species, decreased for two nonforest species, and was unaffected for a generalist species. Abundance estimates under the most parsimonious mixture models were between 1.1 and 8.9 (median 1.8) times greater than estimates based on territory mapping; hence, three surveys were insufficient to detect all territories for each species. We conclude that binomial mixture models are an important new approach for estimating abundance corrected for detectability when only repeated-count data are available. Future developments envisioned include estimation of trend, occupancy, and total regional abundance},\nannote = {doi: 10.1890/04-1120},\nauthor = {K\\'{e}ry, Marc and Royle, J Andrew and Schmid, Hans},\ndoi = {10.1890/04-1120},\nisbn = {1051-0761},\nissn = {10510761},\njournal = {Ecological Applications},\nkeywords = {Abundance estimation,Binomical mixture model,Breeding bird surveys,Count data,Detectability,Index of abundance,Monitoring,Random effect,Replicated counts,Switzerland},\nmonth = aug,\nnumber = {4},\npages = {1450--1461},\npublisher = {Ecological Society of America},\ntitle = {{Modeling avian abundance from replicated counts using binomial mixture models}},\nurl = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-1120},\nvolume = {15},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n\n\n@article{Royle2004,\nabstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},\nauthor = {Royle, J Andrew},\ndoi = {10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00142.x},\nisbn = {0006-341X},\nissn = {0006341X},\njournal = {Biometrics},\nkeywords = {Avian point counts,Binomial population size estimation,North American Breeding Bird Survey},\nnumber = {1},\npages = {108--115},\npmid = {15032780},\npublisher = {Wiley Online Library},\ntitle = {{N-Mixture Models for Estimating Population Size from Spatially Replicated Counts}},\nvolume = {60},\nyear = {2004}\n}\n\n\n\n@article{Iknayan2014,\n         abstract = {Estimates of species richness and diversity are central to community and macroecology and are frequently used in conservation planning. Commonly used diversity metrics account for undetected species primarily by controlling for sampling effort. Yet the probability of detecting an individual can vary among species, observers, survey methods, and sites. We review emerging methods to estimate alpha, beta, gamma, and metacommunity diversity through hierarchical multispecies occupancy models (MSOMs) and multispecies abundance models (MSAMs) that explicitly incorporate observation error in the detection process for species or individuals. We examine advantages, limitations, and assumptions of these detection-based hierarchical models for estimating species diversity. Accounting for imperfect detection using these approaches has influenced conclusions of comparative community studies and creates new opportunities for testing theory.},\n         author = {Iknayan, Kelly J and Tingley, Morgan W and Furnas, Brett J and Beissinger, Steven R},\n         doi = {10.1016/j.tree.2013.10.012},\n         file = {:C$\\backslash$:/Users/Diego/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Iknayan et al. - 2014 - Detecting diversity emerging methods to estimate species diversity.pdf:pdf},\n         issn = {1872-8383},\n         journal = {Trends in ecology \\& evolution},\n         mendeley-groups = {Occupancy},\n         month = feb,\n         number = {2},\n         pages = {97--106},\n         pmid = {24315534},\n         title = {{Detecting diversity: emerging methods to estimate species diversity.}},\n         url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713002619},\n         volume = {29},\n         year = {2014}\n}\n@article{Guillera-Arroita2011a,\n         author = {Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta and Morgan, Byron J.

The model requires a sampling protocol wherein repeated observations are made at a collection of sample locations selected to be representative of the community. This temporal replication provides the data needed to resolve the ambiguity between species absence and nondetection when species are unobserved at sample locations. Estimates of species richness and accumulation are computed for two communities, an avian community and a butterfly community. Our model-based estimates suggest that detection failures in many bird species were attributed to low rates of occurrence, as opposed to simply low rates of detection. We estimate that the avian community contains a substantial number of uncommon species and that species richness greatly exceeds the number of species actually observed in the sample. In fact, predictions of species accumulation suggest that even doubling the number of sample locations would not have revealed all of the species in the community. In contrast, our analysis of the butterfly community suggests that many species are relatively common and that the estimated richness of species in the community is nearly equal to the number of species actually detected in the sample. Our predictions of species accumulation suggest that the number of sample locations actually used in the butterfly survey could have been cut in half and the asymptotic richness of species still would have been attained. Our approach of developing occurrence-based summaries of communities while allowing for imperfect detection of species is broadly applicable and should prove useful in the design and analysis of surveys of biodiversity.},\nauthor = {Dorazio, Robert M and Royle, J Andrew and S\\\"{o}derstr\\\"{o}m, Bo and Glimsk\\\"{a}r, Anders},\ndoi = {10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[842:ESRAAB]2.0.CO;2},\nisbn = {00129658},\nissn = {00129658},\njournal = {Ecology},\nkeywords = {Biodiversity,Conservation,Detection heterogeneity,Occurrence heterogeneity,Site-occupancy models},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {842--854},\npmid = {16676528},\npublisher = {Eco Soc America},\ntitle = {{Estimating species richness and accumulation by modeling species occurrence and detectability}},\nvolume = {87},\nyear = {2006}\n}\n\n\n@Article{FisherEtal43,\n  author =\t {R.
